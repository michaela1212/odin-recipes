      <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, cut into 1 inch cubes</li>
      <li>1 cup fresh blueberries</li>
      <li>12 eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>2 cups milk</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>â…“ cup maple syrup</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Blueberry Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 cup fresh blueberries</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare casserole: Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 1/2
        of the bread cubes in the dish and top with cream cheese cubes. Sprinkle
        blueberries over the cream cheese, then top with remaining bread cubes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk eggs, milk, vanilla extract, and syrup together in a large bowl
        until well-combined; pour over the bread cubes. Cover and refrigerate
        overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove casserole from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before baking.
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake casserole in the preheated oven, covered, for 30 minutes. Uncover,
        and continue baking until center is firm and surface is lightly browned,
        about 25 to 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, prepare blueberry sauce: Mix sugar, water, and cornstarch
        together in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil and cook, stirring
        constantly, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in blueberries, reduce heat to low, and
        simmer until all the blueberries burst, about 10 minutes. Stir in
        butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve portions of casserole on plates and pour warm syrup over top.
      </li>
    </ol>
